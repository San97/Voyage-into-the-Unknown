The helper directory consists of helper functions for calculating heuristics for different heuristics, calculate state
of different cells in maze including start and goal node and calculating g(n) value.

The directory contains 2 more sub directory:

1.)for_new_maze: This directory contains the functions to calculate attributes for the newly created maze in the
                 Repeated A* Algorithm. This new maze will be used by agent and will be updated according to the
                 information received. The directory contains one more sub directory:

                 1.)heuristics: This contains functions to various heuristics to calculate them.

2.) heuristics: This directory contains functions to calculate the heuristics for the actual maze(full gridworld).
