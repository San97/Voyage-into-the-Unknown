Q9 contains 3 more subdirectories but contains files with similar functions but returning different values as per
needed. Each subdirectory contains  4 main kinds of files.
1.) repeated_astar_for_q9.py: This is used to perform tests on repeated forward A* using a specific heuristic.
2.) repeated_astar_for_q9_weighted.py: This is used to perform tests on repeated forward A* using a specific
                                       inadmissible heuristic.
3.)set_attr_new_maze_.py: This is used to set attributes of admissible heuristics according to choice.
4.)set_attr_new_maze_weighted_.py: This is used to set attributes of inadmissible heuristics according to choice.

For all inadmissible heuristic, all these 4 types of files are used.
